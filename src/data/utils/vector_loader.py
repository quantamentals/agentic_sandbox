"""
vector based intent classfication for agentic system interpretation of input, observation and decision of appropriate action based on available tools and resources

Vectorizing these data types can help capture semantic meaning and relationships, improving intent classification accuracy.

    User input data (text, speech, gestures)
    Intent descriptions (API docs, action descriptions)
    Action data (API calls, tool usage)
    Contextual data (user preferences, location, time)
    Knowledge graph data (entity relationships, concepts)
    API documentation (endpoint descriptions, parameters)
    Tool and resource metadata (descriptions, capabilities, limitations)

These data types can be vectorized using techniques like:

    Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)
    Sentence embeddings (Sentence-BERT)
    Graph embeddings (Node2Vec)
    API call embeddings


When vectorized and stored in a vector database (Vectordb), this data can aid a multi-agent system in several ways when querying:

    Semantic search: Agents can query the Vectordb using natural language queries, and the system can retrieve relevant API documentation or interaction instructions based on semantic similarity.
    Intent detection: Agents can use the Vectordb to detect user intent and determine the most suitable API endpoint or action to take.
    Knowledge retrieval: Agents can query the Vectordb to retrieve specific information about API endpoints, parameters, or usage, enabling them to make informed decisions.


In the context of multi-agent systems, this approach can be used to enable:

    Agent knowledge sharing: Agents can share knowledge and retrieve relevant information from the Vectordb.
    Agent collaboration: Agents can collaborate on tasks by querying the Vectordb to determine the most suitable actions or API endpoints to use.

    In an agentic system, vector-based intent classification can be used in several ways:

    User request processing: Agents can use vector-based intent classification to understand user requests and determine the most suitable actions or API endpoints to invoke.
    Task allocation: Agents can use vector-based intent classification to allocate tasks to other agents or services based on their capabilities and expertise.
    Knowledge retrieval: Agents can use vector-based retrieval to retrieve relevant knowledge or information from a knowledge base or documentation repository.
    Decision-making: Agents can use vector-based intent classification to inform their decision-making processes, such as determining the most suitable course of action based on user input.

Some potential applications of agentic systems using vector-based intent classification include:

    Virtual assistants: Agents can use vector-based intent classification to understand user requests and provide personalized assistance.
    Customer service chatbots: Agents can use vector-based intent classification to route customer inquiries to the most suitable support agents or provide automated responses.
    Smart home automation: Agents can use vector-based intent classification to understand user requests and control smart home devices accordingly.
    Business process automation: Agents can use vector-based intent classification to automate business processes, such as data entry or document processing.

To implement vector-based intent classification in an agentic system, you can use various techniques, such as:

    BERT-based embeddings: Using BERT-based models to generate dense vector representations of user input and intent representations.
    Vector databases: Storing vector representations of intents and user input in a vector database for efficient similarity calculation and retrieval.
    Agent frameworks: Using agent frameworks that support vector-based intent classification, such as those built on top of machine learning libraries.

Some benefits of using vector-based intent classification in agentic systems include:

    Improved user experience: Agents can provide more accurate and personalized responses to user requests.
    Increased efficiency: Agents can automate tasks and processes more effectively, reducing manual effort and improving productivity.
    Flexibility and scalability: Vector-based intent classification can handle large numbers of intents and user inputs, making it suitable for complex and dynamic environments.

    
    Improved accuracy: Vector-based intent classification can capture nuanced semantic relationships between user input and intents, leading to more accurate intent detection.
    Flexibility: Vector-based intent classification can handle out-of-vocabulary words, unseen intents, and variations in user input.
    Scalability: Vector-based intent classification can efficiently handle large numbers of intents and user inputs.
    Personalization: Vector-based intent classification can be used to personalize agent responses and actions based on user preferences and behavior.
    Continuous learning: Vector-based intent classification can be updated and fine-tuned continuously as new data becomes available.
